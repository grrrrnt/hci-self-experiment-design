# Studying the Combined Psychological Effect of Exercise, Music and Food Consumption Through Self-Experimentation

A common motivation of self-experimentation (N = 1) is for personal informatics. In doing so, we hope to discover what parts of our lives matter to us the most (Daskalova et al., 2017). By studying data associated with these variables, we can attempt to identify causal relationships between variables in our lives.

Exercising, listening to music and eating are activities known to release “happy hormones”, specifically serotonin, dopamine and endorphins. For my self-experiment, I was interested in combining the feel-good effects of these activities. I sought to explore how concurrently doing physical exercise and listening to music, followed by having breakfast can have an effect on my psychological state. I made the assumption that such an effect (if there was one) would be immediate and short, and would not last the rest of the day. As such, I came up with the following hypothesis:

"On days where I do 60 pushups and sit-ups while listening to my favorite playlist right before breakfast, my average mood for the next 2 hours will increase by 0.5 point on a 5-point happiness scale, but readiness will remain the same each day."
